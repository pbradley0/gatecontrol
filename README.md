ESP32 Gate Control for US Automatic Patriot

This is a small ESP32 project I created to integrate control of my driveway gate with Home Assistant via MQTT.   The Circuit senses the opening of the gate and reports that and also allows the opening and latching open of the gate.  I have also integrated a doorbell by connecting a wireless doorbell and monitoring for a button push and reporting that to Home Assistant.  The gate battery level is also monitored to report the status of the battery so I know when it needs to be replaced.
